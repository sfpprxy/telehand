## Fixed

- Fixed startup-time route/subnet conflicts when EasyTier GUI and Telehand run in parallel on the same host by adding startup precheck, deterministic subnet selection, and conflict-aware retry before entering `running`.
- Fixed Peer Info `Role` rendering to avoid showing the current session role for all rows; now only the self row shows `Client/Server`, non-self rows show `-`.

## Changed

- Changed EasyTier bootstrap from DHCP-default behavior to explicit virtual IPv4 planning (`--ipv4`) derived from network hash and session role.
- Changed Peer Info header to include `网络名称:<hash>` and exposed `network_hash` in both `/api/state` and `/api/peer-info`.
- Added new error code `route_conflict_detected` for startup route/subnet conflict failures.
