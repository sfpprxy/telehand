## Fixed

- Fixed installer behavior for testing pre-release builds by allowing explicit version tags in install scripts, so alpha downloads no longer require manual asset URL editing.
- Fixed release-channel consistency by automatically marking alpha/beta/rc tags as GitHub pre-releases in CI.

## Changed

- Added installer version flags: `install.ps1 -Version <tag>` and `install.sh --version <tag>`; default behavior still installs latest release when version is omitted.
- Updated user and release-notes documentation with pre-release tag examples and versioned installation commands.
