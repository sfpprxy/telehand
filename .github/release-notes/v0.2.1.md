## Fixed

- Fixed false-negative startup decisions where EasyTier had already formed peer transport but Telehand could still loop through subnet candidates and fail to enter `running`.
- Fixed route ownership instability under multi-TUN environments by adding stronger startup conflict handling and per-target host route pinning/cleanup in runtime checks.

## Changed

- Changed connection evaluation to event-first snapshot reconciliation with structured candidate decision logs for easier diagnosis during peer add/remove jitter.
- Changed default bootstrap peer from `tcp://39.108.52.138:11010` to `tcp://43.139.65.49:11010`.
