## Fixed

- Fixed peer fallback attempt behavior so each attempt now starts EasyTier with only the current target peer, avoiding unintended simultaneous bootstrap connections.
- Fixed connecting-stage stability issues where `Peer Info` could blink or disappear on transient empty/self-only snapshots by keeping short-lived cached non-self peer rows.
- Fixed connect-loop robustness by making startup wait/loop logic interruptible and bounded, preventing hangs on `Ctrl+C` and runaway evaluation on repeated `event_snapshot_error`.

## Changed

- Changed networking strategy to multi-peer fallback with input normalization, one-shot latency probing, and low-latency-first ordering before connection attempts.
- Changed session recovery flow to prefer peer-level fallback before subnet switching, with clearer reason codes and improved diagnostics in logs and Web UI.
- Changed bootstrap-only handling to keep current peer and wait for business endpoint readiness (`peer_wait_business_endpoint`), then switch peer after the wait window when still not ready.
