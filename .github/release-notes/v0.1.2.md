## Telehand v0.1.2

### What changed

- Startup sequence redesigned to: API server -> GUI -> EasyTier connection.
- API now starts immediately, making local diagnostics available before network join.
- Added `GET /health` for runtime status (`phase`, `virt_ip`, `api_port`, `gui_port`, `error`).
- Improved release process: each tag now publishes a curated markdown release note file.

### Why this matters

- Easier troubleshooting during `config` and `connecting` phases.
- You can validate API availability without waiting for virtual IP assignment.
- Release pages now show readable change summaries instead of auto-generated commit-style notes.
