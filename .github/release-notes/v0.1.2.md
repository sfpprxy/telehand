## Fixed

- Release page notes are now sourced from curated markdown files rather than auto-generated changelog text.

## Changed

- Startup sequence redesigned to: API server -> GUI -> EasyTier connection.
- API starts immediately, so local diagnostics are available before network join.
- Added `GET /health` runtime status endpoint (`phase`, `virt_ip`, `api_port`, `gui_port`, `error`).
