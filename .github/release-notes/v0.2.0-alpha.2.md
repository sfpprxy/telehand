## Fixed

- Fixed release-note completeness for the 0.2.0 alpha line: this version documents the implemented networking workflow changes from `todo.md` instead of only installer/release-channel updates.
- Fixed inconsistent connection error surfacing by aligning CLI/Web error messages and codes (`auth_failed`, `peer_unreachable`, `tun_permission_denied`, `config_expired`, and existing Windows-specific diagnostics).
- Fixed sensitive data exposure risk in runtime output by masking network secrets in logs and terminal display while preserving operational diagnostics.
- Fixed compatibility behavior by keeping legacy `serve` / `gen-config` paths available and ensuring equivalent outputs/return-code expectations under the unified runtime path.

## Changed

- Added new CLI entry `telehand connect [pairing-code]`, including default network parameter generation, multi-platform remote install commands, and clipboard-friendly workflow for controlled endpoint onboarding.
- Changed `telehand serve` to support direct pairing-code input (positional/`--config`) and automatic connection on startup, removing the previous hard dependency on manual Web paste-to-connect.
- Added shared config/submit utility layer so `gen-config`, `connect`, and `serve` reuse the same build/encode/submit logic.
- Added unified runtime state machine for CLI and Web (`initializing -> connecting -> running/error -> stopping`) with retry handling and graded exit codes (success/param/network/service).
- Added network observability surfaces: terminal periodic PeerInfo refresh, Web PeerInfo table auto-refresh, role/local-node markers, and field alignment (`Virtual IPv4`, `Hostname`, `Route Cost`, `Protocol`, `Latency`, `Upload`, `Download`, `Loss Rate`, `Version`).
- Added release/install channel improvements from alpha.1 in this consolidated note set: installer version pinning support (`install.ps1 -Version`, `install.sh --version`) and automatic pre-release marking for `-alpha/-beta/-rc` tags in CI release workflow.
