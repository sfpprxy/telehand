## Fixed

- Fixed `connect` stuck-in-connecting behavior under TUN permission failures: when logs contain `Operation not permitted` with TUN evidence, runtime now fails fast with `error_code=tun_permission_denied` instead of waiting for full IP timeout.
- Fixed macOS browser auto-open behavior in `sudo` runs: Telehand now opens GUI using the original login user context (`SUDO_USER`) so it follows the user's default browser instead of falling back to Safari in root context.
- Fixed command panel usability in running UI: replaced the single "复制推荐命令" action with explicit per-platform copy actions.

## Changed

- Changed remote command platform presentation from three entries (`Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`) to two entries (`Windows (PowerShell)` and `macOS / Linux`) for consistent command text and lower confusion.
- Changed macOS/Linux startup command guidance to include `sudo` in both README examples and generated remote `serve` command output, aligning docs/UX with TUN permission requirements.
- Added tests for both regressions: early TUN permission-denied detection in `WaitForIP`, and macOS browser-open command construction across normal/sudo/fallback paths.
